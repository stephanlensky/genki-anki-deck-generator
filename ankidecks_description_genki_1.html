This deck is a fork of https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1742947823, which does not seem to be actively maintained.
This deck attempts to fix various typos, as well as remove the subdeck structure and duplicate cards to make better 
use of the Anki software. Contributions welcome, and please report any issues you find on the GitHub.

Much thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mi-ael" rel="nofollow">mi-ael</a> who created the initial deck.
